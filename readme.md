# g48 Projects

This repository is a store for g48 project proposals and links to the deployed versions of those projects.

## Proposal Requirements

In each unit's folder, find the markdown file with your name. You do not need to change this section until your project is approved:

```markdown
**Chosen Project:** TBD
**Project Github:** TBD
**Deployed URL:** TBD
```

For each project proposal, you will need to answer the following question:

* A title for your project
* A two to three sentence description of the project.
* An answer for the following questions:
  * What problem does your project solve?
  * How will your project solve this problem?
  * What web APIs will it use?
  * What technologies will it use?


## How to Submit Your Proposal

* Fork & Clone this repository.
* Write your proposal in that markdown file with your name and create a single commit to your branch.
* Push your branch up to Github.
* Create a Pull Request against this repository from that branch. We will provide feedback on your proposals through that Pull Request!

Once your project has been approved, you can begin work on your project.
