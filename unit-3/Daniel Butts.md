### First Project Proposal Idea

##LiftOff

Work out enthusiasts and beginners always face the same issue, they get to the gym and don't know when set of exercises to do, how much weight they need to be doing this time and in what order. LiftOff provides a platform for gym goers to organize their workouts, seek new fresh content in the form of exercises as well as track their progress throughout their fitness journey.

**What problem does your project solve?**

work out enthusiasts and beginners always face the same issue, they get to the gym and don't know when set of exercises to do, how much weight they need to be lifting this time and in what order to do their exercises.

**How will your project solve this problem?**
 LiftOff solves this by providing a one stop shop for gym goers to submit and consume gym information in an easy to use format.


**What web APIs will it use?**

Nada.... possibly a workout API if I can get my hands on one : )

**What technologies will it use?**
  * Java / Spring for the backend
  * Angular JS for the front end
  * last but not least classic html / css

**Features**
  * allows users to track how much weight they lift for each exercise, how many reps you can do.
  * Provides users suggestions on other exercises to try based off of what muscle groups they are using
  * Allows users (accredited trainers or basic users) the ability to create a work out "plan". A "plan" or "sweat playlist" is a set of 20 or so exercises that have been added by the author for the user to walk through. You could set the pace or filter "sweat playlists" by time / difficulty / body type / time between exercises ect.
  * Also have the ability when adding a exercise to provide an instructional video...


### Second Project Proposal Idea

Job Search Tracker. This will provide a tool for students (or others) to track activity and progress of their job search. The search tracker provided by Galvanize can only capture limited information and provide limited status. Application will provide efficient data entry, status reports, and reminders to make the job search process more effective.

**What problem does your project solve?**

No one likes job searching and it is easy to lose motivation given the low response rate that can be expected from applications.

**How will your project solve this problem?**

The app will provide tools for tracking the stage and progress of various opportunities in a job search pipeline. App will also provide statistics about how many jobs are at each stage, how many jobs the student has applied to per week, etc.

Stretch- integrate user accounts to provide stats on aggregate job searches (Average apps per week, average time between stages, etc.)

**What web APIs will it use?**

One or more job site APIs (dice, indeed, etc.)

Facebook OAUTH (stretch)

**What technologies will it use?**

Java Spring back end
Angular 1.6 front end
Postgres database
Deploy to Heroku
Bootstrap for layout styling
